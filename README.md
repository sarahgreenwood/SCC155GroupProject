Once you have downloaded the project, depending on the text editor your using.  You can either use the version control within the editor, or through the terminal, command line.

For the purpose of creating the project, I have included three folders; Resources, Layouts and BookingSystem.  
  * The designs for the site will be uploaded to the Layout folder.
  * Database structures will be uploaded to the resources folder.
  * The actual site, itself will be developed within the bookingSystem folder. This currently has a basic index.php file included, so that you can see that the installation of the project worked.

This is a public repository, so no passwords should be uploaded.
